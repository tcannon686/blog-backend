# Blog Backend Server
This is the backend server for the blog. You will need to have mongodb and Redis
installed. To run the server, start mongod and redis. Then, run npm start.

I ran the following to run on Ubuntu:
```
$ redis &
$ systemctl start mongod
$ npm start
```

To run the frontend, see the frontend git project.
